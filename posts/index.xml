			<description>Today shall be the official start to completing the Python Challenges by Pybites.
Though technically I started it last week.
Pybites has a long list of about 60 Python Challenges on their website, ranging from simple games to API calls for web servers. I think this is going to be a good opportunity to bring my Python skills to the next level, and hopefully inspire me to be able to start on my own personal project!</description>

<p>So far, I have completed 2 challenges but really have struggled with completing it within a single day each. Usually I take way too long and in the case of the 2nd challenge, I had to look at the solution because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out the algorithm as well. But good start, this means that the challenges must be technically pretty tough. Hopefully this will really help me improve.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
